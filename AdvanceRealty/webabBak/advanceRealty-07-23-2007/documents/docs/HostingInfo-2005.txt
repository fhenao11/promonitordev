Hi,

It is a pleasure to welcome you to our web hosting services. Please save and print this e-mail as it contains important administrative information about your account. We ask that you read this entire email before you start setting up your account with us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

- NEW DOMAIN NAMES

If you have not registered your domain yet, we recommend you register at http://www.DiscountDomainRegistry.com. They only charge $14.99 per domain year. Once you have registered with them, you can update your name servers instantly by logging into their domain control panel located at http://discountdomainregistry.com/manage.shtml and follow the instructions below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

*****THE FOLLOWING IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOUR DOMAIN WILL NOT WORK IF YOU DO NOT FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS.*****

- REGISTERED DOMAIN NAMES

If you have already registered your domain name, please make sure to change your name servers to:

Primary Nameserver: NS.SUCCESSFULHOSTING.COM
Primary IP Address: 64.176.60.107
Secondary Nameserver: NS2.SUCCESSFULHOSTING.COM
Secondary IP Address: 64.176.61.93

For a detailed tutorial and instructions on this procedure please go to http://successfulhosting.com/html_files/support/transfer/transfer.html  .

The above information is important and must be accurate in order for the world to find your domain on our servers and to be able to send and receive email.

Your name server changes should activate within 2-5 days depending on how long it takes those changes to propagate throughout the Internet. Please do not contact us asking how much longer it's going to take since we have nothing to do with this process.

If are with a domain registrar that is charging you more than $14.99 per year for your domain registration, you might want to transfer to our partner http://www.DiscountDomainRegistry.com .

If you are currently hosting your domain name with another hosting company and need instructions on how to move your domain over to us for hosting please visit:
http://successfulhosting.com/html_files/support/troubleshooting/moveaccount.html .

ATT RESELLERS: The above name server changes do not apply to you and your customers if you signed up for a "Reseller Plus" package. You will be using your own domain name servers that we will supply you with. Please make sure to visit the "Reseller Area" in your control panel for more details and instructions on how to set up your own name servers.

2.) To upload to your web site, you have three options:

 - A. FTP into ftp.domain or 65.108.70.164 using your USERID ( ehenao11 ) and PASSWORD ( XvZZ9iN9 .)  Prior to domain registration (or transfer) you will need to use 65.108.70.164 as the FTP hostname. Please view the information posted in our support area for more information on how to FTP and where to FTP into your account:  http://successfulhosting.com/html_files/support.html . You should also only upload your files to the WWW directory of your account if you want anybody to be able to view them.

You will be able to select your files and graphics one at a time and upload them to your domain. If you know HTML you may also edit files that were already uploaded to your web site with this tool as well. NOTE: In order for the public to view your web site, your files must be uploaded into your www directory.

 - C. You can use FrontPage 98, 2000, 2002 or any other site creation tool to upload to your web site. IMPORTANT: Before you use FrontPage you must enable your web site to use FrontPage extensions.

3.)  Setting up email:

Please Note: Your email will not work until you have correctly set up your name servers at your domain registrar and they have correctly propagated throughout the Internet (approximately 48-72 hours.) For a detailed tutorial and instructions on this procedure please go to http://successfulhosting.com/html_files/support/transfer/transfer.html  .

There are two steps to setting up e-mail:

 - A. Setting up mail software on your computer to receive and send e-mail:

You may use an email client such as Outlook Express or Eudora. Most computers come loaded with Microsoft Outlook Express and Eudora is freely available at http://www.eudora.com . 

Here are the settings for your email client:

Incoming Server (POP3): www.buyorsell-yourhome.com
Outgoing Server (SMTP): www.buyorsell-yourhome.com
Your current email address: ehenao11@buyorsell-yourhome.com
Return Address = use the address you want everyone to send mail to

For more information on setting up your email accounts please go to http://successfulhosting.com/html_files/support/manuals/chapter5.html  .
 
You can check and send email online from anywhere in the world using our WebMail user panel - all you or your users need is a web browser and an internet connection. Go to http://65.108.70.164/up/ (or once your domain is resolving you can go to buyorsell-yourhome.com/up/ ) and log in with your email account username and password. All accounts that you have set up through the "Mail Manager" will be able to access their accounts through WebMail.

 - B. Customizing your web site's e-mail accounts:

By default all e-mail sent to your DOMAIN (i.e. webmaster@buyorsell-yourhome.com or root@buyorsell-yourhome.com , etc.) will be redirected to your email account (ehenao11@buyorsell-yourhome.com .)  From there, email can be picked up as a POP or forwarded to an address(s) you provide within your control panel. You can update your email settings, add mail accounts, set up auto-responders, forwarding and much more by logging into your control panel located at http://65.108.70.164/menu (or once your domain is resolving you can go to buyorsell-yourhome.com/menu ) and clicking on the "Mail Manager" tool.

FREE HOSTING

Did you know that you can earn free hosting just by referring a friend, relative or business associate ? Many of our current customers have yet to pay us a penny for hosting! 

For more information, please visit:
http://www.successfulhosting.com/cgi-bin/affiliates/signup.cgi

--------------------------------------------------------------------

MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION

1.) Your cgi-bin has the following path:
 /home/ehenao11/buyorsell-yourhome.com-www/cgi-bin

The URL to your cgi-bin is:
buyorsell-yourhome.com/cgi-bin (or http://65.108.70.164/cgi-bin )
 
You can put your cgi scripts there. If you put in any perl scripts, make sure you have the permissions set to 775 for the perl scripts to be executable. Also, be sure that the perl path in the first line of your script is /usr/bin/perl .
 
The URL to the global cgi-bin (home to pre-written scripts you can use, like the formmail and counter scripts) is buyorsell-yourhome.com/cgi-sys (or http://65.108.70.164/cgi-sys .) 

2.) To see your daily web statistics go to buyorsell-yourhome.com/stats/ (or http://65.108.70.164/stats/ ) for graphical stats and www stats. The stats are updated each day. 
 
3.) General problems to avoid
 - filenames are case sensitive so they must match or you will get a file not found error.
 - transfer perl scripts and text files as ASCII text
 - transfer gif and jpg images as image or binary file type
 - MAC users should transfer files as raw data
 - if your perl script doesn't work, the two most common reasons are permissions are not set right either on the scripts or files and directories they write to, or the paths are wrong.
