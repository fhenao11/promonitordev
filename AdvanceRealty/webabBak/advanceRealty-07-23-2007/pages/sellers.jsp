			<a name="highest"><b>Getting the Highest Price in the Shortest Time:</b></a>
			<br>
			In order to get the highest price in the shortest time, you need to know how
			to market your home. The better you market your home, the more offers you
			will get. And the more offers you get, the more choices you have to get the
			price and terms you want.
			<br><br>
			The most important factor of marketing your home is pricing it right. Your
			price should be adjusted to reflect the market, and the property's worth.
			The key is to get many people checking out your property at a fair price
			instead of having no buyers because your price is set to high.
			<br><br>
			Another important factor is the condition of your home. Make sure that your
			home looks ready to be sold. Fix any defects (peeling or faded paint,
			cracks, stains, etc.) Condition alone can sometimes prompt fast buying
			decisions. Not only should you fix any defects, but consider upgrading your
			home by making major repairs and cosmetic improvements before selling. A
			nice looking home triggers the emotional response that can lead to a
			financial response.
			<br><br>
			Learn how to negotiate the best terms for all parties involved. Terms are
			another factor which may be adjusted to attract buyers. If you insist on
			getting your asking price, think of what you can offer to the buyers, for
			example, improvements you've made, or even offering seller financing at a
			lower than market interest rate on a portion of the sale price. Convince
			them why they should be paying the price you have set.
			<br><br>
			Lastly, get the buzz out about your home. List your house with a hot agent
			that ensures your house is listed on the MLS and on the internet. On your
			own, get the word out. It should be visible to passerby’s that your house if
			for sale, whether it be signs, local advertisements or you telling friends,
			family, and acquaintances.

			<br><br>
			
			<a name="impression"><b>Making a Good First Impression:</b></a>
			<br>
			If you want buyers to be interested in your home, you need to show it in its
			best light. A good first impression can influence a buyer into making an
			offer; it influences a buyer emotionally and visually. In addition, what the
			buyer first sees is what they think of when they consider the asking price.
			<br><br>
			A bad first impression weighs in as deeply. Don't show your property until
			it's all fixed up. You do not want to give buyers the chance to use the
			negative first impression they have as means of negotiation.
			<br><br>
			Ask around for the opinions others have of your home. Real estate agents who
			see houses everyday can give solid advice on what needs to be done. Consider
			what architects or landscape designers have to say. What you need are
			objective opinions, and it's sometimes hard to separate the personal and
			emotional ties you have for the home from the property itself.
			<br><br>
			Typically, there are some general fix ups that need to be done both outside
			and on the inside. As a seller, you should consider the following:
			<br><br>
			<li>Landscaping - Has the front yard been maintained? Are areas of the house
			visible to the street in good condition?
			<li>Cleaning or Redoing the driveway - Is your driveway cluttered with toys,
			tools, trash etc.?
			<li>Painting - Does both the exterior and the interior look like they have
			been well taken care of?
			<li>Carpeting - Does the carpet have stains? Or does the carpet look old and
			dirty?
			<br><br>

			<br><br>
			
			
			
			<a name="why"><b>Know Why You are Selling:</b></a>
			<br>
			If you know exactly why you are selling, then it is easier for you to set
			the right plan of action to get what it is that you want.
			<p align="justify">
			If you are a seller who needs to close a sale as quickly as possible, then
			you should know that getting the highest price possible is not one of your
			priorities. It does not mean that you won't or cannot get the highest price,
			but it means that the price is not the deciding factor. A buyer who can give
			you a quick closing time will appeal much more to you than a buyer who can
			offer you more money but the negotiation and closing time drag on.
			<br><br>
			It's always good to know how low you will go, in terms of selling price.
			This will help to eliminate some of the offers that you find simply
			offensive or ridiculous. Even though you should consider all offers
			seriously and take into consideration the terms of each offer, sometimes, if
			you know the bottom line and are strict about it, you can save yourself
			time.
			<br><br>
			Once you know what your limits and reasons are, discuss them with your agent
			so that they can help you set your goals realistically. If you decide to
			list your home on your own, make sure you do research on the current market,
			and you get the proper advice you need in terms of legal issues, etc. The
			key is to be realistic and to know what your goals are so that they can be
			met.
			<br><br>
			<a href="sellers.asp">Back To Top</a>
			
			<br><br>
			
			
			<a name="price"><b>Setting the Price</b></a>
			<br>
			
			The price is the first thing buyers notice about your property. If you set
			your price too high, then the chance of alienating buyers is higher. You
			want your house to be taken seriously, and the asking price reflects how
			serious you are about selling your home.
			<br><br>
			Several factors will contribute to your final decision. First, you should
			compare your house to others that are in the market. If you use an agent,
			he/she will provide you with a CMA. The CMA will reflect the following: <br>
			<li>houses in your price range and area sold within the last half-year
			<li>asking and selling prices of houses
			<li>current inventory of houses on the market
			<li>features of each house on the market
			<p align="justify">
			From the CMA, you will find out the difference between the asking price and
			selling price for all homes sold, the condition of the market, and other
			houses comparable to yours.
			<br><br>
			Also, try to find out what types of houses are selling and see if it applies
			to your area. Buyers follow trends, and these trends can help you set your
			price.
			<br><br>
			Always be realistic. And understand and set your price to reflect the
			current market situation.

			<br><br>
			
			<a name="action"><b>Plan of Action</b></a>
			<br>
			1)Analyze why you are selling - If you understand your motives, you will be
			able to better negotiate and to get what it is that you want, whether it be
			a quick sale, high price, or somewhere in the middle.
			<br><br>
			2)Prepare you home for the buyer - Maximize the strengths of your property
			and fix up it's weaknesses. You want the buyer to walk away from your home
			with a lasting good impression.
			<br><br>
			3)Find a good real estate agent that understands your needs - Make sure that
			your agent is loyal to you, and can negotiate to help you achieve your
			goals. In addition, they should be assertive and honest with both you and
			the buyer.
			<br><br>
			4)Be prepared for negotiation - Learn and understand your buyer's situation;
			what are their motives? Can you demand a big deposit from them? Try to lock
			in the buyer so that the deal goes through.
			<br><br>
			5)Negotiate for the best price and the best terms - Learn how to counter
			offer to get more from every offer.
			<br><br>
			6)Make sure the contract is complete - Be honest with your disclosures; you
			do not want to lose the deal because you were lying or diminishing your
			home's defects. Insist the buyers get a professional inspection. This will
			protect both you and the buyer.
			<br><br>
			<a href="sellers.asp">Back To Top</a>
			
			<br><br>
			
			<a name="agent"><b>Finding the Right Agent</b></a>
			<br>
			Not all agents work the same way. The most important attribute of an agent
			is that he/she is well connected to the real estate industry. He/she should
			know the market and provide information on past sales, current listings, his
			or her marketing plan, and at least 4 solid references. In addition, you
			also want to look for an agent that is honest, assertive, and one that best
			understands your needs.
			<br>
			Try to go with a local agent. They can better serve your needs; they are
			familiar with what the local market condition is, the local prices are, and
			what's hot or not in your community.
			
			<br><br>
			<a href="sellers.asp">Back To Top</a>
			
			<br><br>
			
			<a name="offers"><b>Considering Offers</a></b>
			<br>
			When reading an offer, keep in mind that you are out to get the best price
			AND the best terms for you. If you focus solely on the price, you may
			overlook terms that could be favorable to you as a buyer.
			<br><br>
			Some terms that may work in your favor:
			
			<li>higher-than-market-interest in a second mortgage for your home
			<li>the buyer will pay for most or all of the closing costs
			<li>the buyer will take care of any repairs
			<li>quick close - the buyer is pre-approved and ready to close in a time
			that best suits you
			<li>all-cash deal
			<br><br>
			When reading through offers, remember to look at the whole package. Take the
			time that you need to assess what is being offered and if it meets your
			needs.
